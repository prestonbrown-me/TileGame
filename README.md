Created By: Preston Brown

Used for East View High School CompSci project.

In the program, a nested for loop is used to create a two dimensional array of tile that can be navigated using
the arrow keys witht the built in ActionListener class. Tiles are created using the built in Random class.
The movement is animated using an offset for all of the tiles that are directly drawn to a JFrame.
